## 🌟 Overview

DataViz Toolkit is a powerful, user-friendly library designed specifically for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) portfolios. It streamlines the process of analyzing major datasets in common formats (CSV, Excel, JSON), making EDA tasks easier, cleaner, and more presentable.
Developed for data scientists, analysts, and students looking to build impressive EDA portfolios, this toolkit automates the repetitive aspects of data exploration while producing publication-quality visualizations and insights. The standardized workflow allows you to focus on interpreting results rather than writing boilerplate code.
The library emphasizes an intuitive API design with sensible defaults while offering deep customization options for advanced users. It integrates seamlessly with Pandas while providing enhanced functionality for common data science tasks. Perfect for academic projects, job applications, or professional data analysis work that needs to be presented clearly.
